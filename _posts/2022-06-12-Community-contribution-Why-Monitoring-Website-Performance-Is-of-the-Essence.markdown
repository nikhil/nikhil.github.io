title: (Community Contribution) Why Monitoring Website Performance Is of the Essence
---

The following article is a community contribution from Ed Carter. Ed is a retired financial planner who runs the site: <a href="https://ablefutures.org/">AbleFutures</a>, where he is working on providing financial literacy for the disabled. He reached out to contribute an article and I am more than happy to help him spread the word! If you would like to contribute an article you can contact me <a href="mailto:nikhil@kumarcode.com">here</a>.

Here is a short bio on Ed:

<blockquote>
Over the years, I’ve worked with clients of all ages, backgrounds and incomes. About 10 years into my career, I saw a need for financial planners who specialize in helping individuals and families living with disabilities. Regardless of their nature or how long they’ve affected someone, physical and mental limitations often cause stress and confusion when it comes to financial planning. Many people are unaware of just how many options they have when it comes to financial assistance and planning, so it’s an honor to offer my experience and change people’s lives for the better.
Now that I’m retired, I’m committed to continuing my services, even though I work on a broader scale than when I was working 9 to 5. I now spend my free time writing financial literacy articles for people to share on their blogs, collecting resource links for people to share on their websites, and collaborating with like-minded folks who want to make a difference.
If you are interested in working with me, please contact me via my contact form. All of my services are free.

In today's digital age, having a website is crucial for businesses. A website serves as an online
presence that can be accessed by anyone from anywhere in the world. However, simply having
a website is not enough to guarantee success. It is essential to monitor its performance
regularly to ensure it stays up and running smoothly. In this article, we talk about the
advantages of monitoring the performance of your website.

## Take Immediate Action If Your Site Crashes

One of the most significant advantages of monitoring your website's performance is being able
to take immediate action if it crashes. If your site goes down, you could be losing potential
customers who are unable to access it. By monitoring your site, Inkbot Design notes that you
can [quickly identify issues](https://inkbotdesign.com/prevent-website-crashes/) and resolve them before they cause significant damage.

## Keep Customer Data Secure

Another advantage of monitoring your site is preventing data loss so you can protect your
customers from a breach. PreyProject.com points out that cybersecurity threats are [becoming increasingly common](https://preyproject.com/blog/what-are-cyber-threats-how-they-affect-you-what-to-do-about-them) in today's digital landscape, making it more important than ever to keep
sensitive customer information secure. By regularly monitoring your site, you can identify
security vulnerabilities and take steps to address them before they become major issues.

## Improve User Experience

Monitoring your website's performance also allows you to [improve user experience](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/improve-your-websites-user-experience). By
analyzing user behavior on your site, you can identify areas that may be causing frustration or
difficulty and make adjustments accordingly. This can lead to increased visitor engagement and
improved conversion rates.

## Get Deeper Customer Insights

Your site can provide valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences. [By tracking user activity](https://www.verfacto.com/blog/behavioral-data/track-user-activity-on-website/), you gain a better understanding of what content resonates with visitors, which
pages receive the most traffic, how long users stay on each page, and much more. This
information can guide future content creation efforts and marketing strategies.

## Maintain Search Engine Rankings

Search engine rankings are critical for driving organic traffic to your website. By monitoring your
site, you can identify and address technical issues that may be impacting your rankings. This
includes checking for broken links and the quality of your backlinks, analyzing your page loading
speeds, and more. By taking steps to optimize your website's performance, you can ensure it
remains visible on search engine results pages. [Regularly monitoring your site](https://jetpack.com/blog/website-monitoring/) further ensures
that everything is functioning correctly and that there are no technical issues that could impact
search engine rankings negatively.

## Optimize Site Performance with AI

Finally, by monitoring your site's performance regularly, you can optimize its overall speed and
functionality. [Slow load times or broken links](https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/high-bounce-rate/) can frustrate visitors and drive them away from
your site quickly. Regular maintenance helps prevent these issues from arising in the first place.
You can use AI to take advantage of real-time website performance monitoring. When you use
[an automation + AI platform](https://www.automationanywhere.com/products/automation-ai), you can automate monitoring and the collection of user data
activity so you’re able to identify suspicious behavior to help prevent misuse. A robust platform
empowers you with process mapping, data integration, and reporting capabilities so your
business can thrive in this digital world.

In conclusion, monitoring the performance of your website offers numerous benefits for your
business. From improving user experience to preventing data loss, regular maintenance
ensures that everything runs smoothly. You can even gain valuable insights into customer
behavior patterns, leading towards more conversions.
