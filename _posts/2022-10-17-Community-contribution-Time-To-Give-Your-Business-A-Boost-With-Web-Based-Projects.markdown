title: (Community Contribution) Time To Give Your Business a Boost With Web-Based Projects
---

The following article is a community contribution from Ed Carter. Ed is a retired financial planner who runs the site: <a href="https://ablefutures.org/">AbleFutures</a>, where he is working on providing financial literacy for the disabled. He reached out to contribute an article and I am more than happy to help him spread the word! If you would like to contribute an article you can contact me <a href="mailto:nikhil@kumarcode.com">here</a>.

Here is a short bio on Ed:

<blockquote>
Over the years, I’ve worked with clients of all ages, backgrounds and incomes. About 10 years into my career, I saw a need for financial planners who specialize in helping individuals and families living with disabilities. Regardless of their nature or how long they’ve affected someone, physical and mental limitations often cause stress and confusion when it comes to financial planning. Many people are unaware of just how many options they have when it comes to financial assistance and planning, so it’s an honor to offer my experience and change people’s lives for the better.
Now that I’m retired, I’m committed to continuing my services, even though I work on a broader scale than when I was working 9 to 5. I now spend my free time writing financial literacy articles for people to share on their blogs, collecting resource links for people to share on their websites, and collaborating with like-minded folks who want to make a difference.
If you are interested in working with me, please contact me via my contact form. All of my services are free.

In the era of digitalization, businesses must establish their online presence to stay ahead of the game. Apart from having a business website and social media pages, it's essential to stand out from the crowd to attract potential customers. Here we present some great web projects that can give your business much-needed recognition and success.

## Consider Website Redesign Investment

The first impression of your business is often your website, so it's vital to ensure that it looks both professional and attractive. Displaying a responsive design that works smoothly on all devices is crucial to making a lasting impression on visitors. Therefore, [investing in a website re-design](https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/designing-websites/website-redesign/) can provide a better user experience, creating customers that will continually return.

If you’re the DIY type and plan to redesign your website yourself, it’s a good idea to update your coding knowledge. Even if you decide to use a template-based authoring tool like WordPress or Wix, coding comes in handy when you’re including features like personalized applets. You can [learn more](https://codeprofs.com/) on the latest hacks by visiting sites that provide guidance and help you troubleshoot errors.

## Ensure Website Accessibility and Usability

When designing or updating your website, [accessibility should be at the forefront](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/web-accessibility) of your mind. Implement features such as descriptive link titles, alt text for images, font size/color contrast, and headings hierarchy to ensure that all users can access your site effortlessly. Moreover, optimize your navigation menu by including clear labels that help visitors find what they're looking for with ease.

## Invest in Security Measures for Protection

In the current landscape where many businesses are transitioning online, cyber security threats pose a significant risk. As a result, investing in measures such as SSL certificates should become standard practice to safeguard both personal and customer data. Kaspersky notes that [implementing additional security measures](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/small-business-cyber-security), such as two-factor authentication, further strengthens your site's defense system against malicious behavior.

## Purchase Online Ad Space

If you're looking to reach more potential customers, consider [online advertising platforms like Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/home/?pli=1), which provide excellent results. Targeted campaigns based on search queries, interests, and demographics can increase conversions while keeping costs low, making it a more cost-effective solution than traditional advertising methods like TV, radio, or print ads. Thus, online advertising can significantly expand your customer base in a very short period.

## Recruit SEO Specialist to Boosting Website Traffic

If you want to drive organic traffic from search engines like Google to your website, hiring an SEO expert is crucial. They will optimize your website's content to make it more visible to search engines, resulting in higher rankings and increased organic traffic directed to your site. Without SEO, your website could be overlooked by potential customers in search of the products or services you offer.

## Automation Tools

By using automation tools, [such as chatbots](https://www.tidio.com/blog/chatbot-for-business/) or email marketing automation software, businesses can save time and provide exceptional customer service by delivering swift and accurate responses to customer inquiries across various communication channels. These tools also enable companies to monitor customer engagement and responsiveness, ensuring prompt resolution of any concerns before they escalate. Ultimately, automation tools help streamline business operations and strengthen customer loyalty, which leads to increased profitability.

## Create Dependable Online Storefront Setup

To successfully sell products online, NerdWallet points out that having [a reliable ecommerce storefront is crucial](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/ecommerce-platforms). This not only provides customers with direct access to purchase from you but also enables them to track orders and shipping details. For an effective storefront, consider using reputable ecommerce platforms such as Shopify or WooCommerce, which offer additional features like discount codes and free shipping to potentially boost sales even further.

## Brush Up Your Business Skills

Don't overlook the possibility of advancing your business acumen by going back to school for an online business degree. Whether you earn a degree in accounting, business, communications, or management, you can learn skills that can help your business thrive. Plus, online degree programs make it easy to run your business while going to school at the same time. As you look at the various programs offered, [this is a good option to consider](https://www.phoenix.edu/online-business-degrees/bachelors.html).

In today's ultra-competitive digital environment, maintaining an online presence is vital for businesses to remain relevant. The sheer volume of rivals constantly competing for consumers' attention underscores the importance of investing in high-quality web projects. By doing so, businesses can not only retain customer loyalty but also entice new ones and gain the necessary edge to thrive and succeed, which is why going back to school to learn the latest business concepts is important to consider.
