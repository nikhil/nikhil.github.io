The following article is a community contribution from Ed Carter. Ed is a retired financial planner who runs the site: <a href="https://ablefutures.org/">AbleFutures</a>, where he is working on providing financial literacy for the disabled. He reached out to contribute an article and I am more than happy to help him spread the word! If you would like to contribute an article you can contact me <a href="mailto:nikhil@kumarcode.com">here</a>.

Here is a short bio on Ed:

<blockquote>
Over the years, I’ve worked with clients of all ages, backgrounds and incomes. About 10 years into my career, I saw a need for financial planners who specialize in helping individuals and families living with disabilities. Regardless of their nature or how long they’ve affected someone, physical and mental limitations often cause stress and confusion when it comes to financial planning. Many people are unaware of just how many options they have when it comes to financial assistance and planning, so it’s an honor to offer my experience and change people’s lives for the better.
Now that I’m retired, I’m committed to continuing my services, even though I work on a broader scale than when I was working 9 to 5. I now spend my free time writing financial literacy articles for people to share on their blogs, collecting resource links for people to share on their websites, and collaborating with like-minded folks who want to make a difference.
If you are interested in working with me, please contact me via my contact form. All of my services are free.

## Tools to Invest In

One beautiful thing about video game development is that you don’t need access to high-end computers or software to start your journey. Some of the most popular tools are free and open-source and give users various pre-built game assets, a visual scripting system, and cross-platform support.

Harnessing a 3D modeling tool can help you create realistic, immersive game environments quickly and efficiently. Not only does this help you craft detailed and lifelike worlds with ease, but it also saves time and money since you don’t have to outsource or hire extra personnel for your development projects. And you can focus more on story and gameplay!

3D modeling tools provide greater control over the artistic elements of a game, equipping you to make precise adjustments with limited coding or programming knowledge. And using such a tool gives you an added level of realism and emotion compared to traditional 2D assets, significantly enhancing the overall gaming experience.

## The Best Learning Opportunities

Video game development is a highly competitive field, and it’s crucial to stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies.

You might also explore game development boot camps and game design schools that offer a more traditional in-person educational experience. While you’re at it, be sure to follow industry news and attend local game development meetups or conferences.
